# Codealpha_Basic-Network-Sniffer
Build a Python program to capture network traffic packets. ● Analyze captured packets to understand their structure and content. ● Learn how data flows through the network and the basics of protocols. ● Use libraries like scapy or socket for packet capturing. ● Display useful information such as source/destination IPs, protocols and payloads.

# Network Packet Sniffer (Python)

## Project Title

Basic Network Sniffer 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Objectives

-   Capture live network packets.
-   Analyze packet structure and content.
-   Understand how data flows through a network.
-   Learn basics of protocols like TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
-   Display useful information such as:
    -   Source IP
    -   Destination IP
    -   Protocol type
    -   Ports
    -   Payload

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Scapy library

Install Scapy using:

    pip install scapy

⚠ Note: Run the script with administrator/root privileges for packet
capturing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Run

    python packet_sniffer.py

Press **Ctrl + C** to stop capturing packets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How It Works

1.  The program uses Scapy's `sniff()` function to capture packets.
2.  Each packet is passed to `process_packet()`.
3.  The script extracts:
    -   IP layer information
    -   Protocol type (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
    -   Source & destination ports
    -   Payload data
4.  Packet details are printed in readable format.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Learning Outcomes

-   Understanding packet structure (IP Header, Transport Layer).
-   Difference between TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
-   How network traffic flows between devices.
-   Basic network monitoring concepts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Important Notes

-   Use this tool only on networks you own or have permission to
    monitor.
-   Unauthorized packet sniffing may be illegal.
